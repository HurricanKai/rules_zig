# Bazel build rules for Zig

Build [Zig code][zig] with the [Bazel build system][bazel].

[zig]: https://ziglang.org/
[bazel]: https://bazel.build/

## Status

ðŸš§ This is a hobby project in early development. ðŸš§

Please [get in touch](https://github.com/aherrmann) if you would like to use
these rules in production.

Take a look at the [planned functionality][planned-functionality] tracking
issue to get a picture of which functionality is already implemented and what
is still missing.
